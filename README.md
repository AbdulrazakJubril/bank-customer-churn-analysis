# Bank Customer Churn Analysis Using Microsoft Excel

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project investigates the reasons behind customer churn in a commercial bank. Over recent months, a significant number of customers have been closing their accounts, and the bank seeks to understand why.  

Using a dataset of **9,992 records and 18 variables**, I analyzed customer demographics, financial attributes, and product engagement to uncover the main drivers of churn. The analysis was done fully in **Microsoft Excel**, with the aim of providing actionable insights that can help the bank strengthen its retention strategies.

- **Size:** 9,992 records, 18 fields  
- **Key Variables:**
  - `CustomerId` â€“ Unique ID for each customer  
  - `CreditScore` â€“ Credit score of the customer  
  - `Geography` â€“ Customerâ€™s country (France, Spain, Germany)

## ðŸ›  Tools and Skills Used
- **Excel Features:** PivotTables, PivotCharts, Conditional Formatting  
- **Functions:** XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, Text Functions, CORREL  
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, standardized formats, created `AgeGroup` feature  
- **Visualization:** Dashboards and charts to explore churn trends

## ðŸ”Ž Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
   - Checked for missing values and duplicates  
   - Standardized binary columns (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
   - Created `AgeGroup` (Young, Middle-aged, Old, Very Old)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Used PivotTables and PivotCharts to explore churn across demographics and engagement  
   - Applied correlation analysis (CORREL) to test numeric variable relationships  
   - Used conditional formatting to flag high churn-risk customers  

3. **Visualization & Dashboard**  
   - Designed an Excel dashboard summarizing churn insights by geography, age, satisfaction score, products, and activity status.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- **Age & Churn:** Older customers (especially middle-aged and very old) were more likely to churn.  
- **Geography:** Germany had the highest churn rate (32%), compared to Spain (16%) and France (14%).  
- **Balance:** Customers with higher balances were surprisingly more likely to leave.  
- **Products:** Customers with 3â€“4 products showed very high churn (83â€“100%).  
- **Complaints:** Customers who lodged complaints churned at much higher rates.  
- **Card Type:** Diamond cardholders churned more than Gold cardholders.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations
1. **Retention Programs for Older & High-Balance Customers**  
   - Loyalty perks, premium support, or dedicated relationship managers.  

2. **Localized Strategy for Germany**  
   - Conduct surveys and improve localized services.  

3. **Reassess Premium Card Offerings**  
   - Improve Diamond card value (rewards, benefits, exclusivity).  

4. **Improve Complaint Resolution Systems**  
   - Faster resolution, proactive follow-ups, and stronger customer support.  

5. **Engage New Customers Early**  
   - Onboarding programs, personalized offers, and early engagement.

## ðŸ“š Conclusion
The analysis revealed that **age, geography, account balance, product type, and complaints** are the strongest churn drivers.  

By implementing targeted retention strategiesâ€”such as loyalty programs, localized actions, improved complaint handling, and product reassessmentâ€”the bank can significantly reduce churn and retain its most valuable customers.  

Future work could involve extending this analysis with **Power BI or Python-based predictive models** for real-time churn prediction.
